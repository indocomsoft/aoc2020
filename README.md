I'm planning to do this year's AOC in Zig (cos I wanna learn) and Prolog (for shit and giggles).
I might also add implementations in some other languages just for fun.

Versions of interpreters/compilers:
- Prolog: SWI-Prolog v8.2.3
- Zig: v0.7.0
- Ruby: v2.7.1p83
- Scala: v2.13.4
- JLite: commit c6959ec32e7a6f3dc7efb407da0800a521c08cfa

## Day 1
- `ans.j` is written in JLite, a language used for my university's compiler course that outputs ARM assembly. You can find the compiler at https://github.com/indocomsoft/jlitec.
- `ans.s` is my compiler's output.
- `ans.pl` is in Prolog
- `ans.zig` is in Zig
- `ans.rb` is in Ruby
- `ans.scala` is in Scala.

## Day 2
- `ans.pl` is in Prolog
- `ans.zig` is in Zig

## Day 3
- `ans.pl` is in Prolog
- `ans.zig` is in Zig

## Day 4
- `ans.pl` is in Prolog
- `ans.zig` is in Zig
